# Building IMDB 

This app builds out basic IMDB functionality in a simple Rails application including displaying a list of movies, viewing a movie's details, and adding a comment to a movie.

To view the app `bin/rails db:setup`, `bin/rails db:seed`, `bin/rails server` and then navigate to `127.0.0.1:3000`.
