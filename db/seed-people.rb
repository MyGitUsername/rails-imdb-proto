              bio: "An important British filmmaker, David Lean was born in Croydon on March 25, 1908 and brought up in a
strict Quaker family (ironically, as a child he wasn't allowed to go to the movies). During the 1920s, he briefly
considered the possibility of becoming an accountant like his father before finding a job at Gaumont British Studios in
1927. He worked as tea boy, clapper boy, messenger, then cutting room assistant. By 1935, he had become chief editor
of Gaumont British News until in 1939 when he began to edit feature films, notably for Anthony Asquith, Paul Czinner
and Michael Powell. Amongst films he worked on were Pygmalion (1938), Major Barbara (1941) and One of Our Aircraft Is
Missing (1942).",
